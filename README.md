## Behavior Driven Development 


|   Behavior Description        |
|-------------------------------|
| 1.  Allows admin to create, read, update, delete & list books in the catalog [√]| 
| 2.  Allows admin to search for a book by author/title [√]|
| 3.  Allows user to check a book out []|
| 4.  Allows user to see all books previously checked out []|
| 5.  Allows user to know when book is due back []|
| 6.  Allows user to read a list of over due books[]|
| 7.  Allows user to enter multiple Authors for a book[]|

USER TO ADD 
a checkout method -> allows user to check out a book & gives a "due date" for the user. 
a key that lists all the books the user has "checked out" currently?
a return method --> allows the book to be returned to "library" ?

we need a KEY on book "in_library" true or false? automatically true unless "checked out" returned to true when user checks book back in. 


Stretch Goalzzz
- allow author to be generated when admin enters in book info
- allow query for when users search for an author, if the author name already exists prompt user with author name? 
- allow a "sign in" with a password & assign an admin
